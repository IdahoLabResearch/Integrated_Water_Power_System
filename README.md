# Interdependent Water and Power Infrastructure Model (IWPIM)

IWPIM is simulation model that analyzes water-power interdependencies to identify vulnerabilities, enhance system resilience, and support sustainable infrastructure solutions for rural systems. Rural and remote communities are at a heightened risk of disruptions in essential water and power systems. Failures in one infrastructure often cascade into the other, amplifying impacts and jeopardizing critical services. The model analyzes the impacts of diruptions of the water system on the power system, and vice versa. More details on the software can be found on [IWPIM page](https://inlsoftware.inl.gov/product/IWPIM)

A detailed description of this software methodology can be found in this [Journal Article](https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(24)08153-2).


## Required Software
This model is built using Python, version 3.12.7, and PythonPDEVS, a modular simulator for the Parallel DEVS formalism. 
Installation for PythonPDEVS can be found [here](https://msdl.uantwerpen.be/documentation/PythonPDEVS/index.html), and information on DEVS [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9004690).
